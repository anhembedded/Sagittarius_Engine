"""Shared fixtures for `widgets/` tests.

`get_theme_bridge()` is a process-wide, first-caller-wins singleton (see
its own docstring) — some other test module in the full session (e.g.
`test_overlay_host.py`'s all-`#000000` placeholder, which is fine there
since that suite "doesn't exercise theming") can and does win the race
when the whole engine suite runs together, silently making every token
this package reads collide with every other. Two fixtures follow from that:

- `_theme_bridge_ready` (autouse): guarantees SOME palette is present, for
  tests that only need presence/structure, not cross-token distinctness
  (does this role produce non-empty QSS containing `background-color:`,
  does the live value of a single named token appear in the output, ...).
- `fake_theme_bridge`: for tests that specifically need two DIFFERENT
  tokens (e.g. `muted` vs `accent`, distinguishing a disabled button from
  an enabled one) to actually differ — the only session-order-independent
  way to test that is to not depend on the real shared singleton at all.
