"""`EPIC-010` — the store that remembers nothing, on purpose.

@details Two distinct reasons to need this, both real:

  - `BasePresenter`'s dependency on a state store is optional
    (`architecture-rule.md`'s "framework provides mechanism" boundary): an app
    or test that never registers `UiStateExtension` must still construct
    presenters. `container.resolve()` raises `DependencyResolutionError` on an
    unregistered type, so the fallback has to be a real object, not `None`.
  - The Sanity tier boots the real composition root and must not write to the
    developer's disk. `tests/sanity/conftest.py` already loads the real
    `user_config.json`; this store is what keeps a UI-state extension from
    making that worse.
