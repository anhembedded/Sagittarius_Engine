"""`EPIC-010` D1/B2 — the persistent store, backed by a second `ConfigManager`.

@par Why not a hand-written JSON store
The project already has exactly one persistence paradigm: `ConfigManager`,
`set()`, `save()`. Adding a second way to put a dict on disk would cost every
future reader a second thing to learn, for no behaviour the first one lacks.
Measured — `scripts/ui_state_store_feasibility_probe.py` — a second
`ConfigManager` instance already provides the two hardest parts for free:

  H2  `save()` writes only the keys `set()` since the last save, merged onto
      the file's current contents. That is per-slice merge, which is what makes
      lazily-constructed presenters safe.
  H3  `JsonSource.read()` swallows `JSONDecodeError` and yields `{}`, so a
      truncated file degrades to defaults instead of blocking boot.

@par Why not the same file as `user_config.json`
It is git-tracked and holds `API_KEY`/`API_SECRET`, and the Sanity tier loads
it with `writable=True`. More fundamentally, a *preference* is declared by the
user and must be honoured verbatim, while a remembered value is a side effect
of using the application and must be discardable in silence. Opposite failure
policies do not belong in one file.

@par The accepted cost
`ConfigManager.save()` opens the file with `open(path, "w")` — no temp file, no
rename. A crash mid-write truncates it, and the next launch falls back to
defaults everywhere. For hint-class data that is an acceptable loss, and it is
the same "hints may be lost" logic applied consistently. It is locked by
`test_truncated_file_yields_empty_document_without_raising` rather than left as
a comment, because `architecture-rule.md` §7.1 requires an accepted cost to
have a test.
