"""`EPIC-010` — the session store, and the test double.

@details One class serving two roles is not a shortcut here: a `SESSION` scope
is defined (design §4.2) to never reach disk, so its store *is* "hold this in a
dict until the process ends" — which is also exactly what a test needs from a
store it can inspect. There is no second thing to build.
