    the same reasoning `application/ports/i_config_reader.py` records for
    itself. Four verbs cover every caller: read one slice, replace one slice,
    drop one slice, and force pending work out.

    @par Never raises
    Every implementation swallows I/O failure, logs once, and degrades. Callers
    reach this port from `teardown()`, and an exception there is exactly the
    class of defect `BUG-048` was: a failure on the shutdown path that hung the
    process instead of reporting.
