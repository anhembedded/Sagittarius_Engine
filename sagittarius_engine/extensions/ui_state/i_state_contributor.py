"""`EPIC-010` — what an object must offer to have its state remembered.

@details `typing.Protocol`, not an ABC to inherit from.
`architecture-rule.md` §2 forbids multiple inheritance, and every real
contributor (a `BasePresenter` subclass, or `MainWindow`, a `QMainWindow`
subclass) already has a base class of its own. A Protocol is satisfied
structurally, so it costs nothing to adopt and never touches the MRO —
`PresenterManager.register()` is deliberately duck-typed for the identical
reason: *"this router deliberately does not require that base"*.
