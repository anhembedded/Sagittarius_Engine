"""`EPIC-010` D4 — debounced writes, one store, many contributors.

@par The debounce is not hand-written timing logic
Measured (`EPIC-010` design §5.6.6 row 8): `QTimer.setSingleShot(True)`, then
calling `start()` again on every change, *restarts* the countdown rather than
queuing a second firing — three rapid `start()` calls in a row produced
exactly one `timeout`. So this class does bookkeeping (which contributors are
dirty) rather than timing arithmetic.

@par Why one shared timer, not one per contributor
Matches the coalescing behaviour the design's sequence diagram describes:
changing the symbol and then the interval inside the debounce window is one
user action in spirit and becomes one write, covering every contributor that
went dirty in that window — not one write per field.
