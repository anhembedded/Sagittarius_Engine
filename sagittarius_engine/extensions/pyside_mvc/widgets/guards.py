@brief Static guards for `pyside_mvc.widgets` — the QtWidgets counterparts
to the QML kit's `tokens.qml_literal_guard`/`kit.raw_primitive_guard`
(EPIC-006, see `Sagittarius_Elite_Warrior/Tasks/epics/EPIC-006_drop_qml/
DECISION_2026-08-24_widget_architecture.md` §6).

@details
Three guards. Two match a QML one each has a direct counterpart for:

- `find_inline_stylesheets` — no hardcoded colour literal outside
  `widgets/style.py` (the one file `apply_role()`/`_build_qss()` live in).
  Counterpart to `tokens.qml_literal_guard.find_literal_colors`.
- `find_unscoped_container_stylesheets` — no `setStyleSheet()` written as a
  bare property list on a widget that owns a layout. A list with no selector
  is Qt's **universal selector**: it repaints every descendant that has no
  rule of its own, handing the container's border and background to each
  child inside it. Harmless on a leaf, which is why the check only reports
  widgets that actually have children. This is `BUG-008`, and it has since
  recurred four more times in the consuming app — a guard, not a fix, is
  what stops the fifth.
- `find_bare_qt_base_widgets` — no `class X(QFrame)`/`class X(QDialog)`/
  `class X(QWidget)` outside `widgets/surface.py`/`widgets/overlay.py`
  themselves, barring a `# base-exempt: <reason>` line. Counterpart to
  `kit.raw_primitive_guard.find_raw_primitives` ("no raw primitive authored
  outside the kit").

The coverage-guard counterpart (`kit.gallery_coverage_guard`'s QtWidgets
equivalent) exists as of EPIC-007C, but not as a function here: it needs a
running `QApplication` to construct the gallery, which every other guard in
this module deliberately does not. It lives in
`tests/extensions/pyside_mvc/widgets/test_showcase_coverage.py`, reading
`tools.widget_showcase.showcased_types()`, and fails when a type in
`widgets.__all__` is never built by the showcase.

All three scan source without importing it, so none needs Qt. Within *this* repo they are
still exercised only through `tmp_path` fixtures — pointing them at
`sagittarius_engine/` itself remains outstanding.

The consuming app wired them up in EPIC-007D/E
(`tests/unit/presentation/ui/test_widget_guards_hold.py`): colour literals
locked at zero, bare Qt bases held under a ratchet that may only fall. That
is what `colour_source_names` exists for — an app's palette module is its
`style.py`, and until it could be named, the guard reported that file for
containing the very tokens it defines, which put zero out of reach.

#: Same three lengths QML's colour guard matches (`#rgb`/`#rrggbb`/
#: `#aarrggbb`) — Qt's QSS colour literal syntax accepts the same forms.
_HEX_COLOR_RE = re.compile(r"#(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{8}|[0-9a-fA-F]{6}|[0-9a-fA-F]{3})\b")

#: Same exemption convention as `qml_literal_guard._EXEMPT_MARKER` — a
#: deliberate, reviewed exception, visible on the same line as the literal.
_EXEMPT_MARKER = "token-exempt"

#: The one file inline-stylesheet literals are permitted in, for this
#: package's own tree. A consuming app keeps its colours somewhere else —
#: the reference consumer's is `assets/palette.py` — and names it through
#: `find_inline_stylesheets`'s `colour_source_names`. Hardcoding this one
#: name meant an app could never reach zero findings: the file defining its
#: tokens was itself reported, fifteen times, for containing tokens.
_STYLE_MODULE_NAME = "style.py"

#: `class Name(QFrame)` / `class Name(QDialog)` / `class Name(QWidget)` as a
#: direct base — matches only when the class body opens right after (a
#: trailing `metaclass=...` kwarg or multi-base declaration is out of scope
#: for this codebase's current style, same "match the real shape, not every
#: hypothetical" call `raw_primitive_guard` makes for its own two controls).
#:
#: `QWidget` joined the set in EPIC-007A. Measured on the consuming app the
#: day it was added: `QFrame`/`QDialog` alone found 12 classes in
#: `Sagittarius_Elite_Warrior/src/presentation/ui`, while 9 more were
#: surfaces authored as `class X(QWidget)` and sailed straight through —
#: `LogPanelWidget`, `AppProgressBarWidget`, `TimeRangeCardWidget`,
#: `DevBoardPanel`, `BackTestTopPanel`, `BackTestTradeLogsPanel`,
#: `DynamicTabBarWidget`, `_CachedFrameOverlay`, `_BotParamFieldWidget`. The
#: "12" this guard used to report was a floor, not a count.
_BARE_QT_BASE_RE = re.compile(r"^\s*class\s+\w+\((QFrame|QDialog|QWidget)\)\s*:")

#: Files where `Surface`/`Overlay` themselves legitimately extend
#: `QFrame`/`QDialog` directly — the one sanctioned place per base.
#:
#: `QWidget` has no entry here on purpose: this package derives no surface
#: from it (`Surface` is a `QFrame`, `Overlay` a `QDialog`), so there is no
#: sanctioned file to name. A legitimate `QWidget` base outside this package
#: — a pure layout composite, an MVC view root — is waved through by
#: `_BASE_EXEMPT_RE` below, per case and with its reason in the source,
#: rather than by exempting a whole file.
_BASE_DEFINITION_FILES = frozenset({"surface.py", "overlay.py"})

#: A class declaration line carrying `# base-exempt: <reason>` is a
#: deliberate, reviewed exception.
#:
#: Its own marker, not `find_inline_stylesheets`'s `token-exempt` — exactly
#: the call `kit.rectangle_card_guard` already made when it spelled its
#: escape hatch `card-exempt`: the axis here is a **base class**, not a
#: literal value, and one marker per axis keeps an exemption from silencing
#: a guard it was never reviewed against. EPIC-007A's task file asked for
#: `token-exempt` to be reused; that predates noticing `card-exempt`'s
#: precedent, and the deviation is recorded in the task file.
#:
#: Stricter than both older markers in one way: the reason is **required**,
#: not merely conventional. `token-exempt`/`card-exempt` match on presence
#: alone, so a bare marker silences them. This axis is new, so nothing
#: depends on the looser spelling, and an exemption nobody justified is how
#: a guard quietly stops meaning anything.
_BASE_EXEMPT_RE = re.compile(r"#\s*base-exempt\s*:\s*\S")

#: Same exemption convention again, for a container that genuinely means to
#: paint its descendants.
_CASCADE_EXEMPT_MARKER = "cascade-exempt"

#: The QSS properties that actually show when they leak downward. `color`
#: is left out on purpose: text colour inherits in Qt anyway, and a
#: container setting it for its labels is the normal way to do that.
_CASCADING_PROPERTIES = ("border", "background")

#: Qt widgets that hold children **without** a layout, so the layout-owner
#: check below never sees them. Missing this class of container is not
#: hypothetical: the reference app styled its `QStackedWidget` — the widget
#: holding *every screen* — with a bare property list, and the guard walked
#: straight past the largest cascade in the whole application.

    @brief Finds `setStyleSheet()` calls written as a bare property list on a

    @details A QSS string with no selector is Qt's **universal selector**. It
    repaints every descendant that does not carry its own rule for the same
    property — so a container styled this way hands its border, its
    background and its radius to every label, field and button inside it.

    Only widgets that own a layout are reported. The same string on a leaf is
    the ordinary way to style one widget, and flagging those would bury the

    unscoped stylesheets narrow to 16 containers.

    `color` is deliberately not among the properties watched: text colour
    inherits in Qt regardless of selectors, and a container setting it once
    for its labels is idiomatic rather than a mistake.

    **Static, and therefore conservative.** Widget ownership is read from the

    `.setLayout()`, or one constructed from a Qt class that holds children
    without a layout at all (`QStackedWidget`, `QTabWidget`, `QSplitter`,
