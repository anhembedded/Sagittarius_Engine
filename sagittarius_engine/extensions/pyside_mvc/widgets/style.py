@brief Composition-based styling for `pyside_mvc.widgets` — the QtWidgets
replacement for the QML kit's `Sagittarius/UI/` (EPIC-006, see
`Sagittarius_Elite_Warrior/Tasks/epics/EPIC-006_drop_qml/
DECISION_2026-08-24_widget_architecture.md`).

@details
`Surface`/`Card`/`Overlay` and each `Styled*` control share no common base
beyond their own single Qt lineage (`QFrame`/`QDialog`/`QPushButton`/...) —
PySide6/Shiboken forbids a class inheriting two QObject-derived bases, which
rules out a shared styling mixin across those lineages. `apply_role()` is
the composition that replaces it: every widget in this package calls it
once, in its own `__init__`, instead of inheriting styling behaviour.

This module is the ONLY place in `pyside_mvc.widgets` permitted to build a
stylesheet string from token values — the guard counterpart to the QML
kit's `tokens.qml_literal_guard` (`widgets.guards.find_inline_stylesheets`)
enforces that no other file in this package (or a consuming app's own
widgets, once it starts using this base) calls `setStyleSheet()` with a
hex literal or token value baked in directly.

    widget — never an unrelated sibling elsewhere in the tree — so the
