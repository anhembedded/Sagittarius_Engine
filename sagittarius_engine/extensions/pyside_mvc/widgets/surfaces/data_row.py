    """
    @brief One label per column, optionally followed by a row of action
    buttons.

    @details
    **Not a `Surface`.** It was written as a `Panel`, which gave every row a
    card background, a border and a radius — so a forty-row table rendered
    as forty stacked cards. All three of the reference consumer's row
    widgets are transparent or zebra-striped and not one has a border; the
    surface in a table is the *table*, and a row is content sitting on it.

    That is the same call `TabBar` needed for the same reason, and the
    asymmetry is what decides it: a consumer that wants each row framed can
    put the row in a `Panel`, while a consumer that does not want a frame
    has no way to take a `Panel`'s away. Both widgets shipped as `Surface`
    subclasses before either had a real consumer to check against — the
    defect is the missing consumer, not the choice.

    Built from three of the reference consumer's four row widgets — its
    status row (6 cells + 4 action buttons), its candle row (8 cells, one
    of which is already written as exactly this loop over a column spec),
    and its gap row (5 cells + 1 button).

    **Its trade-log row is deliberately excluded**, and this is the call
    `EPIC-007B`'s own risk note asked for. That widget is not a wider
    version of this one: it *is* a `QPushButton`, three of its six columns
    stack two lines of differently-styled text, two of its cells are
    recoloured badges, it owns a collapsible detail pane of three further
    columns, and it emits a toggle signal. Fitting it would need a
    per-cell widget factory, an expandable-body hook and a click signal —
    at which point every part of the base is overridden and the base is
    carrying parameters that exist to please one caller.

    **Cells are filled by `set_cells`, never by the constructor.** Three of
    the four consumers already work this way, building empty and refilling
    on model change; the gap row instead takes its data as constructor
    arguments and therefore cannot be updated at all, which is why its own
    dialog has to destroy and rebuild every row on every refresh. Adopting
    the fillable shape is what lets a consumer stop doing that.
