    @details The reference consumer's three log panels all bind
    `runtime.log_list_model.LogListModel`, but this panel never names that
    class — it needs a `QAbstractItemModel` that also offers a change signal
    and the two actions the header buttons invoke. Written as a `Protocol`
    rather than an ABC because the model is a `QObject` subclass and cannot
    take a second metaclass (`widgets.style`'s module docstring covers the
    same constraint for widgets).

    @brief A `Card` whose body is a log list, with an entry-count badge and
    Copy/Clear buttons in the header.

    @details
    **The line cap is not here, deliberately.** `LogListModel.MAX_ENTRIES`
    already trims oldest-first inside `append()`, and the reference consumer
    layers a second configurable trimmer on top of that. A `max_lines`
    parameter on this widget would be a third enforcement point for one
    rule — the widget would then either disagree with the model or silently
    do nothing, and both are worse than not offering it.

    **No auto-scroll, matching every existing consumer.** The QML kit this
    replaces had `autoScroll` with a follow-only-if-already-at-bottom guard;
    the QtWidgets port dropped it and all three panels have run without it
    since. Restoring it changes what users see, so it belongs in a migration
    task that can be reviewed and reverted, not smuggled in through a base
    class. Recorded as a candidate in `EPIC-007B`.

    Copy and Clear call straight through to the model, as the consumer's
    panel does — there is no presenter round-trip to preserve, and both are
    no-ops until a model is set.
