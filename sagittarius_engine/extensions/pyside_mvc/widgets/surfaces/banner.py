    @brief A `Panel` with an optional leading icon, a message, and an
    optional trailing action button, coloured by severity.

    @details
    Covers four of the reference consumer's five banners: its preview
    (info + icon + static text), stale (warning + icon + dynamic text +
    a "run again" button), coverage (warning + text only) and audit
    (success/danger switched at runtime + emoji icon + text).

    **Severity is settable after construction**, unlike the consumer's four
    backtest banners which each bake their colours in at build time. The
    audit banner is why: it recolours itself on every sync depending on
    whether the check passed. Making that the general case costs nothing —
    the four static ones simply never call `set_severity` again.

    **Its fifth banner is deliberately not covered.** That one's whole body
    is a progress bar with a cancel button whose label changes between
    "cancel" and "cancelling"; it has no icon slot and no message of its
    own. It shares only "a rounded panel that stays hidden until needed"
    with these four, so folding it in would mean a `progress: bool` that
    switches the class between two unrelated layouts. Recorded in
    `EPIC-007B` as a separate `ProgressBanner` candidate.

    The icon is a `str`, not a pixmap: the consumer's banners are split
    between icon-loader pixmaps and bare emoji, and this package has no
    icon loader to depend on. A consumer wanting a pixmap sets one on
    `icon_label` directly.

    Not dismissable. None of the five has a close button — visibility is
    always driven externally from view-model state, so a `dismissable`
    flag would be a parameter with no caller.
