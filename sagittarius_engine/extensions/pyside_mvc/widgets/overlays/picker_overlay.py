    @details The consuming app's six pickers each hold their options in a
    different shape — `list[str]`, and three different dict spellings
    (`key`/`name`, `value`/`label`, `id`/`label`). Rather than teach this
    class four vocabularies or take an extractor callback per picker, each
    consumer maps its own shape into this one. That keeps the variance in

    @brief An `Overlay` presenting `PickerItem`s as `SelectableCard`s in a
    list or an N-column grid, with an optional search field.

    @details
    **Choosing does not close the dialog.** `selection_changed` fires and
    `selected` updates; calling `accept()` is the consumer's move. Five of
    the app's six pickers do accept immediately, so closing here would look
    like the obvious default — but the sixth (its time-range picker) must
    stay open when "custom" is chosen, to reveal its own fields. A base that
    closed for them would need a flag to be told not to, and every consumer
    already writes that one line today.

    Single-select only. The app's indicator picker is multi-select, toggles
    checkboxes, and never closes — a genuinely different interaction, not a
    parameter of this one. Left as a candidate rather than guessed at, the
    lesson EPIC-006's four abandoned card stubs paid for.

    `set_items()` rebuilds the rows outright. The app repeats a manual
    drain-and-refill loop in eight places, always from `showEvent`, because
    the option list arrives asynchronously; this is that loop, written once.
